1. For the colour pallete I went with these colours because
    a) The navbar felt more cleaner and the text seemed to feel emphasised even with the simple white colour.
    b) The buttons felt more "clickable" when using a darker colour such as orange instead of cyan or pink which I initially thought to use.
2. For the font I didn't feel like I had much time to ponder upon, so I tried Times New Roman but it felt too stern, so I went with sans serif(serif for the smoother edges)
3. The service cards were an idea that I remember seeing somewhere and one that I tried to replicate
